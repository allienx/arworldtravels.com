SoCal born and raised, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Graduates, sports lovers, and adventure junkies, we decided to quit our jobs and put our careers on hold in order to travel and experience the world!

â€‹After graduating from college in 2014 we went straight into the working world and have been in it for the last three years - Alex in software development and Rachel in Healthcare Recruiting.

One day while walking on the beach in San Diego (our home for the last 3ish years), we started talking about all the places we wanted to explore and realized the list seemed too long for a couple of week long vacations using PTO.

In that moment, we made the decision to actually make long term travel plans and start saving! Yes, it was risky and required a lot of money and planning but we ultimately realized there is no better time than now - if we didn't do something like this while we're young and free of longterm monetary commitments, we likely never would.

Flash forward and we have a one way ticket to Europe, our first three hostels booked, a rough outline of our route, and our minds open to what the next several months throw at us!
