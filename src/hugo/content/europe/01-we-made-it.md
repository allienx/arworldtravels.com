We made it to Copenhagen!

Our flight went by fast - direct flight from LAX on Norwegian Air (although all the flight attendants were Thai interestingly enough). We got the emergency exit row which was nice so we could spread out a bit - Al especially was happy about that with his long legs. The food was meh but Al got his own personalized gluten free meal which had a note on it that said "For Mr. Alex". We didn't sleep much but somehow kept ourselves preoccupied watching a movie, and talking to the German man sitting next to Al telling us things we should do in Germany.

We arrived at our gate quickly and had to wait a while for our luggage but it came thank goodness! And of course the second I put it on and started walking I knew it was too heavy and I had packed too much....oh well! There was also a gluten free sandwich place in the airport - I think we were both nervous about the GF food situation here but the selection has turned out to be surprisingly abundant! Al has had no problems finding good things to eat and I get way more excited than him when we find a place with GF bread, etc.

After taking the metro, we arrived at our hostel called "Sleep In Heaven" situated in a "local", hipster and less touristy neighborhood called NÃ¸rrebro. We took a quick power nap and then went and got some sandwiches at a shop close by. Last night we somehow managed to do a pub crawl with our hostel which consisted of people from 5 different countries which was pretty cool. We went to 3 bars - one of which was a ping pong bar. Boy were the Danes into their Ping Pong! But Al gave them a run for their money and won a few games.

Even though we've only been here 1 day, Al and I have been quick to make some observations of the people, city, etc. In one word we would describe it as "mellow". Bikes! Bicycles are everywhere. There are barely any cars on the road and people leave their bikes with only a tire lock leaning against buildings - I feel like this would be unheard of in San Diego - I got my bike stolen when it had 2 locks on it! The people are very tall and beautiful and the women in particular appear very low maintenance, most not even wearing makeup and just casual clothes. It's kind of refreshing to see. All the locals we've talked to have been very friendly and happy so far. Of course, we forgot we could get into any bar without needing to show ID and have the freedom to walk the streets with a drink in hand (but this is common to all of Europe I think).

So far we are really enjoying ourselves here! Especially now that we have gotten a good nights sleep and are adjusted to the time difference. More to come soon!
